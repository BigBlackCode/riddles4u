### The riddle of Ramanujan

Srinivasa Iyengar Ramanujan FRS (22 December 1887 – 26 April 1920) was an Indian mathematician and autodidact who lived during the British Raj. Though he had almost no formal training in pure mathematics, he made substantial contributions to mathematical analysis, number theory, infinite series, and continued fractions. Ramanujan initially developed his own mathematical research in isolation; it was quickly recognized by Indian mathematicians. When his skills became obvious and known to the wider mathematical community, centred in Europe at the time, he began a partnership with the English mathematician G. H. Hardy. The Cambridge professor realized that Srinivasa Ramanujan had produced new theorems in addition to rediscovering previously known ones.

In December 1914, a story – riddle published in the English magazine Strand, which initially occupied Cambridge's student, P. C. Mahalanobis, And then his friend, Ramanujan.

“A certain street has between 50 and 500 houses in a row, numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, … consecutively. There is a certain house on the street such that the sum of all the house numbers to the left side of it is equal to the sum of all the house numbers to its right. Find the number of this house.”

    The problem can be solved  using a variety of methods. Using trial and error methods  you can find that the only acceptable solution is this:
</p>
 
<p>    
    1 + 2 + 3 + … + 203 = 205 + 206 + … + 288. House number 204, on a street with 288 houses.
</p>

<p>    
    Without restrictions 50 and 500, there were other solutions. For example, on a road with 8 homes, the right answer would be the No. 6 house:
</p>    

<p>
    1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 7 + 8

### The Riddle of Einstein

Albert Einstein (14 March 1879 – 18 April 1955) was a German-born theoretical physicist. He developed the theory of relativity, one of the two pillars of modern physics (alongside quantum mechanics). Einstein's work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science. Einstein is best known by the general public for his mass–energy equivalence formula E = mc2 (which has been dubbed "the world's most famous equation"). He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics "for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect", a pivotal step in the evolution of quantum theory.

The zebra puzzle is a well-known logic puzzle. Many versions of the puzzle exist, including a version published in Life International magazine on December 17, 1962. The March 25, 1963, issue of Life contained the solution and the names of several hundred solvers from around the world.

The puzzle is often called Einstein's Puzzle or Einstein's Riddle because it is said to have been invented by Albert Einstein as a boy; it is also sometimes attributed to Lewis Carroll. However, there is no known evidence for Einstein's or Carroll's authorship and the Life International version of the puzzle mentions brands of cigarette, such as Kools, that did not exist during Carroll's lifetime or Einstein's boyhood.

It is often claimed that only 2% of the population can solve the puzzle.

There are five houses in five different colors in a row. In each house lives a person with a different nationality. The five owners drink a certain type of beverage, smoke a certain brand of cigar and keep a certain pet. No owners have the same pet, smoke the same brand of cigar, or drink the same beverage. Other facts: 

1. The Brit lives in the red house. 
2. The Swede keeps dogs as pets. 
3. The Dane drinks tea. 
4. The green house is on the immediate left of the white house. 
5. The green house's owner drinks coffee. 
6. The owner who smokes Pall Mall rears birds. 
7. The owner of the yellow house smokes Dunhill. 
8. The owner living in the center house drinks milk. 
9. The Norwegian lives in the first house. 
10. The owner who smokes Blends lives next to the one who keeps cats. 
11. The owner who keeps the horse lives next to the one who smokes Dunhill. 
12. The owner who smokes Bluemasters drinks beer. 
13. The German smokes Prince. 
14. The Norwegian lives next to the blue house. 
15. The owner who smokes Blends lives next to the one who drinks water. 

**The question is: who owns the fish?**

### Sumerian Riddles

Dating back to cuneiform tablets written in the 18th century BC, the following two ancient Sumerian riddles hold clues to a person’s quest for knowledge.

The following Sumerian Riddles are timeless and cause a person to contemplate words in ways which impart significant meaning on different levels.  Although some of the ancient riddles’ intentions may be lost to time, others are realized, and reveal valuable insights.

- *A house based on a foundation like the skies*

- *A house one has covered with a veil like a secret box*

- *A house set on a base like a goose*

- *One enters it blind,*

- *Leaves it seeing,*

- *Answer: the School*

In a commentary on the riddle (sourced below), the word for skies could also translate to ‘heavens’ or ‘god’.  The second verse seems to imply the House is hidden and, I feel, the third verse suggests it may be guarded.  A goose is known for its protection of the nest and hissing.  Could ‘set on a base like a goose’ imply the school is guarded and teachings are not given to merely anyone

Another Sumerian riddle found on the same tablet asks:

- *“An open house*

- *A locked up house,*

- *He sees it,*

- *But even then it remains closed.”*

**(who is he?)**

To answer this riddle a person has to think of what ‘open and closes’ in a ‘house’?  One easily considers a door, but why does it remain closed?  The answer given is a ‘deaf person.’  Here, the door compares to the ‘Mouth’ and since a ‘deaf’ person can see it (the mouth) open and close, it (the house/knowledge/words) remains locked/unheard.
