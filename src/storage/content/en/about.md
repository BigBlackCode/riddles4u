## About Riddles4U

Riddles4U was developed mainly due to our love for puzzles and riddles. Here at BigBlackCode we felt that an original riddles game was missing from the web and decided to create an open source game with our own original riddles and distribute it free to the players. 

The riddles are crafted from our team and they are tested before being included in the game. We have tried hard to make them as strict as possible but riddles have always a subjective part while solving them so please to not be judgemental if the solution does strike you immediately. This is why riddles exist after all!

This is not only a strict game but also a riddles platform which you can use to build up your own riddle games. Code knowledge is required to make some key modifications (such as content updates and layout changes) but apart from that the platform will work without a database making it really simple to use. You can find more information about the codebase on [GitHub](https://github.com/BigBlackCode/riddles4u).

Feel free to send us your feedback on specific riddles or the whole game experience at [riddles4udotcom@gmail.com](mailto:riddles4udotcom@gmail.com).
